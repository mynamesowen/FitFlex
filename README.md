# FitFlex
iOS app made in Swift 4 meant to teach the user benefits of partiular exercises with instructions on how to do them.

## Backstory
FitFlex is an iOS application written in Swift 4 that was developed for the iPhone 8 plus. I built this in my final year of college as my capstone project which I needed for graduation. 

The most challenging aspect of building this application is that I had no guidance and no professors I could go to if I found myself struggling or needing help. Throughout the course of my capstone I would provide progress updates to the director of the applied computer science program. When I first expressed my interest in building a mobile app she warned me that she had no experience with the field so I would be unable to use her knowledge as a resource. Regardless, I was motivated to move forward with my idea.

My favorite part about developing this application was capturing the starting and ending position for each exercises. Every photo was taken in the campus gym over the course of a few days. The two people you see in the photos are my two good friends Josh and Ashley. Spending time with them while at the same time working towards completing my project was very gratifying and fulfilling.
